[Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a fantastic open-source, headless Node.js CMS and my go-to system for setting up content sites (e.g. my consulting business site [itpeters.com](https://itpeters.com/) or my private travel logbook [reisepedia.de](https://reisepedia.de/)). Essentially, it’s a customizable platform for running blogs, magazines, or journals. It’s fully [open-source](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) and runs blogs including OpenAI, DigitalOcean, and Mozilla.

The Ghost Foundation is offering a hosted version of Ghost, so it's accessible for non-technical content creators. This is really great and should be used by all means, if you don't want to deal with the technical aspects of running a web server. For me, however, it comes natural to set up a Ghost instance on my own server with the [offical Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost/) and Dokku.

There are also a ton of themes for purchase (and for free!) on Ghost’s official website. I personally like the themes from [Bright Themes](https://brightthemes.com/), which are very well designed and easy to customize.
