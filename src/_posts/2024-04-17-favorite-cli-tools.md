In software development, getting to know the command line feels like you've suddenly got your hands on a wizard's staff. These command-line tools saved me heaps of time and can pull off some pretty neat tricks.

It's all about sharing the love and the magic, so let's dive in and maybe you'll find a new favorite or two!

##  `bat` - a cat(1) clone with wings

I love this. It's a drop-in replacement for `cat` that adds syntax highlighting, Git integration and lots more. It's written in Rust and is blazing fast. [sharkdp/bat: A cat(1) clone with wings.](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

### How to use `bat`

To glance at a file using `bat`, simply provide the path:

```sh
bat /path/to/your/file
```

The syntax highlighting and file-specific metadata make `bat` a joy to use, ensuring you can inspect code and text files efficiently and with finesse.

## `Homebrew` - The missing package manager for macOS

It's simply a must-have for every Mac user. Whether it's installing a new programming language, a database server, or the latest web framework, `Homebrew` streamlines the process, taking out the need for locating and manually downloading software.

### The brew command

Working with `Homebrew` is straightforward:

```sh
brew update
brew install <package>
```

`Homebrew` also handles dependencies, ensuring that your software stack remains tidy and up-to-date with a simple command. Plus, with over 4,800 official packages and a thriving community of contributors, you're sure to find everything you need.

## `httpie` - HTTP client for the command line

Making HTTP requests from the command line has never been more elegant than with `httpie`. It simplifies interaction with APIs and web services, offering a user-friendly interface and an eye-pleasing HTTP request syntax colorization.

### Crafting requests with `httpie`

A basic GET request:

```sh
https httpie.io/hello
```

Output:

```json
{
    "ahoy": [
        "Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for trying out HTTPie ðŸ¥³",
        "We hope this will become a friendship."
    ],
    "links": {
        "discord": "https://httpie.io/discord",
        "github": "https://github.com/httpie",
        "homepage": "https://httpie.io",
        "twitter": "https://twitter.com/httpie"
    }
}
```

And the response is structured, formatted, and legible. `httpie` also supports POST, PUT, DELETE requests, authentication, and other advanced features. It's a great alternative to `curl`.

## `jq` - Command-Line JSON Processor

`jq` is a sed-like tool that parses, manipulates, and displays JSON objects from the comfort of the command line. It excels at selectively filtering and transforming complex JSON data, which is a common task when working with APIs and backend services.

### Transforming with `jq`

Filtering results:

```sh
https httpie.io/hello | jq "{links}"
```

This will present the URL from the curl JSON response, making `jq` a key player for any serious developer juggling JSON data.

## `lando` - Local Development Environment and DevOps Tool Built on Docker Containers

For local development with the ease of a one-command setup, `lando` is a mighty ally. It configures and manages Docker-based development environments, providing an abstraction layer that spares developers the anguish and complexity of Docker configuration files.

### A `lando` Starter

Creating a WordPress site:

```sh
lando init --recipe wordpress
```

And with that simple command, you're on your way to local WordPress development with a containerized environment. `lando` integrates with other tools such as `composer`, `npm`, and `gulp` to streamline development workflows. It's an excellent tool for building, testing, and deploying applications locally.  One of the most powerful features is the ability to define multiple environments in a single configuration file (e.g. local, staging, production) that can be easily switched between.

## `ohmyzsh` - A Delightful Framework for Managing Your Zsh Configuration

`ohmyzsh` transforms the already powerful `zsh` into a feature-rich and stylish terminal environment. With themes, plugins, and an active community contributing to its growth, `ohmyzsh` makes the terminal experience more personal and productive.

### Managing `zsh` like a charm

Switching themes is as simple as editing your `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
ZSH_THEME="Dracula"
```

Followed by a quick:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Your terminal then reflects the chosen theme, potentially improving your workflow by keeping you more engaged. `ohmyzsh` also comes packed with a variety of plugins that add new features to `zsh`, such as an auto-suggestion tool and syntax highlighting, making it even more powerful. These can be easily enabled or disabled through the `~/.zshrc` file as well.

## `rbenv` - Ruby Version Manager

For managing multiple Ruby environments, `rbenv` is a vital cog. It allows for per-project Ruby versions, which is a blessing when working on legacy software that demands older Ruby interpreters alongside the current releases.

### Balancing Ruby versions

Selecting a Ruby version for your project:

```sh
rbenv local 3.3.0
```

This indicates that the local project should use Ruby 3.3.0, leaving others unaffected by the change. When executing `bundle` command, or any other code that requires a Ruby environment, `rbenv` will use the specified version. This keeps developers from experiencing surprises when their global Ruby version is updated, and your project breaks.

## `zsh-autosuggestions` - Autosuggestions for Zsh

`zsh` users will find `zsh-autosuggestions` a game-changer. This tool offers context-aware auto-completion, predicting your command line needs with eerie accuracy, and saving precious keystrokes in the process.

### Follow the flow

Simply start typing a command and, based on your history, `zsh-autosuggestions` will begin offering predictions. You can cycle through suggestions with the right arrow key or accept one with the tab key.
