title: "This website and the Bridgetown site generator"
---

For this personal website, I like to keep it lean and minimal and the blogging software or CMS should stay out of the way. It shouldn't be a hassle to maintain or update. So in 2022 I started this site with the [Bridgetown](https://bridgetownrb.com/) static site generator.

Having become an avid fan of Ruby in my recent developer years, a Ruby-powered static site generator seems a good fit. Bridgetown stands on the shoulders of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), which became immensely popular through Github Pages.

Blog posts are written as Markdown files, which will be compiled to HTML by Bridgetown. Thanks to [andrewm](https://andrewm.codes/deploy-bridgetown-to-github-pages/) for the writeup on how to setup the Github Pages plugin to automatically publish the site when pushing new content.
