# About me

I'm Lars, a web software developer from Germany. I develop and operate web applications with Ruby on Rails and the Drupal content management system for my clients. Another field of work is telephony applications (IVR - Interactive Voice Response) with the FreeSWITCH and Asterisk open-source telephony frameworks. Most services run on AWS infrastructure.

When not in the office, I enjoy travelling, being on the water windsurfing, paddling, biking or hiking. I also volunteer for the local chamber of commerce as a member of the examination board for IT vocations.

You can find some notes on what I'm currently up to on my [now page](/now/).
