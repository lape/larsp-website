I'm Lars, a Web Software Developer from Germany. For my clients I develop and operate web applications with Ruby on Rails and the Drupal Content Management System. Another field of work are telephony applications (IVR - Interactive Voice Response) with the FreeSWITCH and Asterisk open source telephony frameworks.

When not in the office, I enjoy being on the water windsurfing, SUPping, biking or going for a hike. I also volunteer for the local chamber of commerce as a member of the examination board for IT vocations.
