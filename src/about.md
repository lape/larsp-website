I'm Lars, a web software developer from Germany. For my clients I develop and operate web applications with Ruby on Rails and the Drupal content management system. Another field of work are telephony applications (IVR - Interactive Voice Response) with the FreeSWITCH and Asterisk open source telephony frameworks. Most services are operated on AWS infrastructure.

When not in the office, I enjoy travelling, being on the water windsurfing, SUPping, biking or going for a hike. I also volunteer for the local chamber of commerce as a member of the examination board for IT vocations.
