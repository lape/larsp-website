# Now Page

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff/) this is just a fun page for sharing what my current focus is:

## Working on

* Integrating and completing DATEV API services for 1159.
* Preparing new Coop Pronto campaigns (see [Barcode PDFs with Ruby on Rails](/rails/barcode-pdfs-with-ruby-on-rails/)).

## Learning

* Working on my Ruby on Rails skills.

## Reading

* Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir.
* Rebuilding Rails by Noah Gibbs.

## Clearing up

* Logging our past travels with my [Ghost](/webtech/ghost-cms/) system [Reisepedia](https://reisepedia.de/).
