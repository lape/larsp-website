# Now Page

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff/) this is just a fun page for sharing what my current focus is:

## Working on

* Integrating and completing DATEV API services for 1159.
* Preparing new Coop Pronto campaigns (see [Generating PDFs with Rails](/rails/generating-barcode-pdfs/)).

## Learning

* Working on my Ruby on Rails skills.

## Reading

* Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman.
* Rebuilding Rails by Noah Gibbs.

## Clearing up

* In the process of terminating a cooperation I co-founded more than 10 years ago that we didn't use anymore the last years.
