# Now Page

Inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff/) this is just a fun page for sharing what my current focus is:

## Working on

* Migrating FreeSWITCH systems to a new data center.
* New customer self-service portal.

## Learning

* [Jumpstart Pro](https://jumpstart.pro/) SaaS framework.

## Reading

* Die with Zero by Bill Perkins.
* The Comfort Crisis by Michael Easter.

## Clearing up

* Clearing out unused domains I always wanted to do something with.
* Integrated draussen.blog unter [draussen.reisepedia.de](https://draussen.reisepedia.de/).
* Logging past travels with my [Ghost](/webtech/ghost-cms/) system [Reisepedia](https://reisepedia.de/).
