title: What I'm up to now
---

Inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">Derek Sivers</a> this is just a fun page for sharing what my current focus is:

## Working on

* Finishing and launching the user membership portal for gardasee.de.
* Integrating and completing Schufa API services for 1159.
* Hosting and overwatching the Coop Pronto campaigns we developed during the last months of 2022.
* Updating some Drupal 8 sites.

## Learning

* Working on my Ruby on Rails skills.

## Reading

* Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman.
* Rebuilding Rails by Noah Gibbs.

## Clearing up

* In the process of terminating a cooperation I co-founded more than 10 years ago that we didn't use anymore the last years.
