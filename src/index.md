# Welcome to larsp's personal site

Hi, I'm Lars - a Ruby on Rails and Drupal software developer from Germany. This is my personal website where I write about my journey as a full stack developer and take notes on things Iâ€™ve learned along the way.

If you like, you can read more [about me](/about/), how [this website](/webtech/bridgetown/) was made or what I'm up to [now](/now/).
