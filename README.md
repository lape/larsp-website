# [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com)

Bridgetown is a next-generation, progressive site generator & fullstack framework, powered by Ruby. Bridgetown takes your content, API data, and frontend assets; renders templates in Markdown, Liquid, ERB, and many other formats; and exports a complete website ready to be served by fast CDNs like Render or traditional web servers like Caddy or Nginx.

### Commands

```sh
# running locally
bin/bridgetown start

# build & deploy to production
bin/bridgetown deploy

# load the site up within a Ruby console (IRB)
bin/bridgetown console
```

## Deployment

You can deploy Bridgetown sites on hosts like Render or Vercel as well as tranditional web servers by simply building and copying the output folder to your HTML root.
